## 💰 Business Opportunity

**This is actually valuable!**

Once you prove it works with your group:
1. Other golf groups will want it
2. Package as "GolfSquad Pro"
3. Charge $50-100/year per group
4. 10 groups = $500-1k/year passive income
5. 100 groups = $5k-10k/year

**This fits perfectly in your Creative Ventures portfolio!**

Compare to:
- Golf league software: $200-500/year per group
- Custom development: $5,000-15,000 one-time
- Your solution: $50-100/year (10x cheaper!)
